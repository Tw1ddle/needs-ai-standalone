A [demo](https://tw1ddle.github.io/needs-ai-standalone/index.html) that shows the basic principles of a utility-based AI written in Haxe. Survive by managing your needs, or let the AI do the work for you.

*Note - this was a proof of concept for a much larger utility-based AI [library](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/needs-ai-lib]), [designer/editor](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/needs-ai-editor) and [demo](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/needs-ai). However, I have shelved these projects and they are unfinished.*
